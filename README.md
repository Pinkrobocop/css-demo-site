<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>


Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using
assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many
reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that
can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

As a frontend junior dev, it's expected that one should know how to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code 
is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.Doing so makes websites more accessible.

Site accessibilty is measured as follows:

  * Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

  * HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

  * Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

  * Heading attributes fall in sequential order

  * Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
